**Bistec** is a subtitle editor for Mac OS X. It is coded using Cocoa and it intends to be agile and user-friendly. It is currently in an early stage and may be full of bugs. In fact, it does not format .srt files properly yet. It currently supports .srt files only, but in the future it will support many more formats.

**Features**
  * Watch the video you are subtitling while you work. Note that the video format must be supported by Quicktime. You can open almost any file by installing [Perian](http://www.perian.org) and [Flip4Mac](http://www.flip4mac.com/).
  * Easy shortcuts for setting _in_ and _out_ time codes on the fly, creating and removing subtitles.
  * Simple, easy to use interface.

**Features to come**
  * Support for other subtitle formats (dvb, ssa, sub, ...).
  * Re-encoding of video for hard subtitling.
  * Ability to export subtitles as video (with transparent background).
  * Spell-checking.
  * Adjusting (time code shifting, automatic resizing, ...).
